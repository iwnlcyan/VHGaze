        " Human Toolkit is built with RIDE.\r\nRapid Integration & Development Environment (RIDE) is a " +
        "research and development rapid prototyping testbed using real-time 3D game engines. It " +
        "primarily targets the Unity game engine, with early support for Unreal Engine. RIDE has a " +
        "vendor-agnostic API that allows porting to other engines, including VBS4.\r\nRIDE is a collaboration" +
